# Next.js Hello World


This example shows the most basic idea behind Next. We have 2 pages: `src/pages/index.js` and `src/pages/about.js`. The former responds to `/` requests and the latter to `/about`. Using `next/link` you can add hyperlinks between them with universal routing capabilities.

The app in this repo is deployed at https://next-js.onrender.com.
